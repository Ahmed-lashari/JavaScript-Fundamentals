# 📘 JavaScript Fundamentals for Beginners (By a Flutter Dev)

> **“Learn JavaScript from scratch examples for total beginners”**

---

## 👋 Why This Exists

I’m a **Flutter developer** who wanted to learn **TypeScript** to write seamless backend/server-side functions — especially for database interactions with tools like Supabase and Firebase.

But before jumping into TypeScript, I had to make sure my JavaScript fundamentals were solid.

So I started learning from scratch using sources like:

- 📗 [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
- 📹 [Apna College - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdRvxDWH4w&t=4667s)

While learning, I realized that most tutorials are either boring or don’t use relatable examples — so I created this small course using real-life examples like fruits (Mango, Banana), cities (Lahore, Karachi), and fun situations (marriage proposals, picnic plan, tea etc).

This is written in **easy English**, with comments in **Roman Urdu** to help absolute beginners from Pakistan/India.
